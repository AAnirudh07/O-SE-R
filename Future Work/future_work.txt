In the second version of O-SE-R, we plan to add the following:

1. Create a novel dataset with UML classes, attributes, stereotypes, methods, aggregations, compositions, inheritance.
2. Create an object localization code capable of recognizing aggregations,compositions, stereotypes and methods.
3. Create a method to identify the numbers on top of the associations.
